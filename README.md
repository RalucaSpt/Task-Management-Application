  - **Read:** View tasks in a grid or list format, with filtering options based on category.
  - **Update:** Edit tasks using the "Edit" button for each task and a form for modifying task details.
  - **Delete:** Remove tasks using the "Delete" button for each task.
- **Routing:** Components include routing functionality for seamless navigation within the application.
- **Form Validation:** Validate form fields either client-side or server-side to ensure data integrity.
- **MongoDB Database:** Utilize MongoDB as the database backend, with a custom database schema.
- **SignalR Communication:** Implement SignalR to notify clients in real-time when a task is added.
